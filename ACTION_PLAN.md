# Kubernetes Deployment Modernization Action Plan

## Overview

Transform the current simple k3s deployment into a secure, scalable, and automated Kubernetes deployment workflow that works consistently across local, staging, and production environments using modern DevOps best practices.

## Current State Analysis

- **Current Approach**: Direct YAML manifests with hardcoded secrets and configs
- **Deployment**: Manual script-based deployment (`deploy-all.sh`)
- **Secrets**: Base64 encoded secrets directly in YAML files (insecure)
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific configs mixed with deployment manifests
- **CI/CD**: No automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Environments**: Only local development supported

## Target Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Kustomize**: For configuration management and environment overlays
- **SOPS**: For encrypted secrets management
- **Helm**: For complex service deployments (optional, for third-party services)
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation
- **Skaffold**: For local development workflow
- **ArgoCD**: For GitOps deployment (production)

## Detailed Implementation Guide

### 1. Base Kustomize Configuration

Each service will have a base configuration with:
- Deployment with proper resource limits and health checks
- Service definitions with appropriate selectors
- ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- ServiceAccounts with minimal required permissions
- PodDisruptionBudgets for high availability

### 2. SOPS Secret Management

```yaml
# Example encrypted secret structure
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backend-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  database-url: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:...,iv:...,tag:...,type:str]
  redis-password: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:...,iv:...,tag:...,type:str]
```

### 3. Environment Overlays

Each environment overlay will include:
- Resource scaling configurations
- Environment-specific ingress rules
- Namespace configurations
- Environment-specific secrets
- Monitoring and logging configurations

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# Example workflow structure
name: Deploy to Environment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
      - name: Security scan
      - name: Build images
  
  deploy-staging:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
      - name: Run integration tests
  
  deploy-production:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
      - name: Health checks
```

### 5. Skaffold Configuration

```yaml
# skaffold.yaml for local development
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta6
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
    - image: backend
      context: ../backend
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    - image: auth-handler
      context: ../auth/authentication-handler
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile

deploy:
  kustomize:
    paths:
      - overlays/local

portForward:
  - resourceType: service
    resourceName: backend
    port: 8000
```
